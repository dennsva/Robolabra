/**
 * Testing of shortest path finding and leJOS navigation features using a TuioPoseProvider that
 * communicates with a PC, receiving X/Y-coordinates and the angle of fiduciary markers seen by a 
 * camera. The robot has a fiduciary marker placed on top of itself so it can know its location
 * and heading.
 * 
 * The robot uses two touch sensors for convenience because the fiducial on top of my robot was just
 * printed on a paper attached to a piece of cardboard that two pins hold in place and the buttons
 * are out of reach. When the program starts, it makes a repeating sound (you can stop this by pressing
 * recalcButton).
 * 
 * On the NXT, when creating a TuioPoseProvider object it starts listening for the PC to contact it.
 * Once connection has been established by running TuioTransmitter on the PC, TuioTransmitter listens
 * for TUIO messages in UDP port 3333 on the PC. ReacTIVision and other TUIO output enabled programs can 
 * provide these messages (fiduciary marker information, but with slight modification also other types).
 * 
 * After NXT and PC are connected, put your camera above the robot so it has an overhead view of the
 * area and make sure it's near enough so that it can reliably identify the individual markers when
 * the robot is moved around the visible area. You should ideally place the camera so it can look directly
 * down for best results. Using a camera with a big resolution should allow you to place it higher
 * (mine seems to just work with 640x480 with reacTIVision) and to see a bigger area. You could also
 * use a fisheye lens to see more, reacTIVision can correct the distortion.
 * 
 * After the camera is fixed above the robot, run reacTIVision and invert the Y axis and angle (press 'i'
 * and use arrow keys).
 * 
 * Now the robot should be making a repeating noise. Hold recalcButton for a short while so that it stops
 * repeating the sound and says "command?". Adjust map geometry with fiducials so at least one complete
 * wall is seen (fiducials 2&3 and 4&5) and that the robot and its target are also visible to the camera
 * and their fiducials are detected (0 for robot, 1 for target). Then press recalcButton again (making sure
 * your body doesn't get in the way of the camera) and the robot will calculate the map and shout "yeah!"
 * if successful. Now you can press searchButton and if the robot can get to the target, it should say 
 * "commencing..." and start driving towards the target using shortest path and shout "yeah!" again when
 * it reaches it.
 * 
 * If the robot refuses to move, it says either "huh?" or "your move, creep". "Huh?" usually means that at
 * their current locations, for some reason, either it can't see a complete wall or itself or the target.
 * If it says "your move, creep", it means that it failed to calculate a path, most likely due to not having
 * room to move with the chosen clearance. Try making the map less crowded or adjust the robot or wall
 * positions slightly. (And check that your reacTIVision is running and the PC is transmitting coordinates.)
 * 
 * You can move the target and the robot around at will and press the searchButton to make it find the target
 * again, but if you touch the map geometry such as walls, you need to press the recalcButton to update the 
 * map.
